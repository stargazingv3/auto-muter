            <p>Before we start, please review our data handling practices.</p>
            <p><strong>What the extension does:</strong> Auto Muter identifies when a specific person is speaking in a browser tab and automatically mutes it.</p>
            <p><strong>What data is collected:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>To enroll a speaker, you provide a YouTube URL. We download the audio, create a mathematical "voice print," and then delete the original audio.</li>
                    <li>When active, the extension sends short audio snippets from the tab to our server for analysis. These are **never stored** and are deleted immediately.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>By clicking "Agree," you consent to this data processing. For full details, please read our <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
